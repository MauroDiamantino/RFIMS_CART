 * 	\brief This file contains the declarations of classes AntennaPositioner and GPSInterface.
 *
 *	These classes are responsible for the positioning of the antenna, which can rotate its azimuth
 *	angle and its polarization. To model these rotations it were used the Cardan angles (or nautical angles):
 *	the "yaw" angle which represents the heading, the "pitch" angle which represents the elevation and the
 *	"roll" angle which models the bank angle. The yaw angle is used to represent the antenna's azimuth angle,
 *	the roll angle is used to represent the antenna polarization and the pitch angle is not used.
 *	\image html cardan_angles.png "The Cardan or nautical angles"
 *	\image latex cardan_angles.eps "The Cardan or nautical angles" width=10cm
 *	Moreover, the class GPSInterface allows to get data related with time and date, elevation (based on
 *	pressure), ambient pressure, among other things.
 *
 *	Also, several structures are defined here which store data related with the mentioned classes.

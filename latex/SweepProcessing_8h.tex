class \hyperlink{classRFPloter}{R\+F\+Ploter}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em The class {\itshape \hyperlink{classRFPloter}{R\+F\+Ploter}} is intended to plot sweeps, RF interference (\hyperlink{structRFI}{R\+FI}) and any frequency curve. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item

\item 
class \hyperlink{classFrontEndCalibrator}{Front\+End\+Calibrator}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em The aim of this class is to calculate the total gain and total noise figure curves versus frequency of the RF front end. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
class \hyperlink{classRFIDetector}{R\+F\+I\+Detector}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em The aim of this class is to compare each calibrated sweep with a threshold curve to determine where there is RF interference (\hyperlink{structRFI}{R\+FI}). \end{DoxyCompactList}\item

\subsection{Detailed Description}
This header file contains the declarations of the classes which are responsible for the processing of each sweep, once it has been captured. 

The tasks which are performed by the classes defined here are the following\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Plotting of sweeps, \hyperlink{structRFI}{R\+FI} and any frequency curve.
\item Adjusting (interpolation) of frequency curves.
\item Front end calibration.
\item \hyperlink{structRFI}{R\+FI} detection.
\item Data logging. \begin{DoxyAuthor}{Author}
